Testing :mod:`pyCart`
---------------------

Many of the API tests can be confined to the :mod:`cape` version.  In addition,
several of the central aspects of the command-line interface, such as index
subsetting commands, are tested here despite the fact that the ``cape``
command-line interface is not really a practical tool.
