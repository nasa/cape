About This Documentation
=========================

Generally a "using this documentation" section is a sign of documentation that
is poorly written or overly complex.  Unfortunately it feels unavoidable in
this case, although reading this section is not overly critical for
understanding the rest of the documentation.

There are some aspects of notation that are repeated throughout the
documentation, such as bold symbols, italic symbols, etc., and having a brief
glossary of this notation is intended to be helpful rather than essential for
reading the documentation. There is also a small amount of Python nomenclature
that is used in the documentation.

Two separate versions of this documentation exist: an HTML version and a PDF
version.  Both versions are created from the same source text using Sphinx.
Due to its length, the API documentation is only included in the HTML version. 
However, a PDF version of the full documentation including API can be generated
on request.
